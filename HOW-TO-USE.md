1. **Material counter**<br />
Display material amount you own or you invested into character aptitudes and the maximum needed material amount to upgrade every owned characters aptitudes to level 10 (this should never happen but it's calculated). As you can see `Dvalin's Sigh` material contains 5 characters, 4 are using `Dvalin's Sigh` for all 3 aptitudes and `Traveler (Geo)` use `Dvalin's Sigh` only for normal attack aptitude. One aptitude need 6 materials to be fully upgraded (level 10 or 13 if you have constallation bonus, see 4.)

2. **In inventory materials**<br />
This field is used to tell the software how much material you have in your inventory, this field is automatically decreased when you upgrade an aptitude level, exemple for Amber's 3rd aptitude, passing it from level 6 to 7 will decrease the In Inventory field by 1 and will increase Amber's material counter to [1/18].

3. **Character data**<br />
This is here you set your character level, phase, constellation and aptitude levels. Phase is the number of ascensions you pass for the character (represented as stars in-game) this field is automatically increase when you set the character level, exemple : set level to 80 will set phase to 5 and set level to 81 will set pahase to 6, automatically.

4. **Aptitude field**<br />
This is where you set the aptitude level, left field is for normal attack, middle field is for elemental skill and right field for elemental burst. An orange value indicate you have the +3 bonus from a constellation. Tartaglia's normal attack always have a +1 bonus, so it's displayed in orange too.

## Resin optimisation purpose of this software

This software is made to help you optimize your resin before doing weekly bosses, it indicate what bosses materials you need for your characters aptitudes and what bosses you don't need to do anymore. As you can see in the screenshot, i've finished `Dvalin` and `Andrius` since i reach the max material amount for them (204 for Dvalin and 210 for Andrius) and i can use `Dream Solvent` to convert a certain material type to another. Thereby i can use my resin into other bosses or elsewhere.
