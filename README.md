### ➡️ About Windows SmartScreen "Windows protected your pc"

During installation, Windows SmartScreen can block the installation by warning the user about risks of uncknown apps, this warning is due to my app code signing. It's a free app and i'll not buy a Microsoft Code Signing Certificate to make this warning disapear, it cost 200~350$ per year.
